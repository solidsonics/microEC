# microEC
The world's smallest electrochemical workstation.

#### What is it?
A wireless tiny electrochemistry potentiostat module for your electrochemical sensor or other fancy ideas.

#### How big is it?
Coin-size!! (24 mm x 27 mm x 5g ONLY).

#### What does it do?
I’m now working on integrating all kinds of EC characterization methods on this small PCB and hope it can be helpful for your EC related DIY, microEC can do both potentiometry and amperometry, here I list some available experiments you can do with microEC:
1. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). The MOST fundamental, useful and popular EC experiment.
2. I-T. You will love it when you want to demonstrate some EC sensing applications.
… (more exp coming soon)

#### How does it do?
It supports both BLE and USB communication,
Based on the API I’m now working on, you can control and read data from the microEC wirelessly by your phone or by your laptop USB. (yes, a Gui is also under development).
For BLE, you may need a costumize BLE-based APP for your specific idea.
For the USB, any software for serial test could be ok.
The USB can be also used for charging the battery (if you need). A charging management system and an automatic powering switch are already integrated into this PCB so no need to worry anything about the battery, just plug it in.

#### Why did you make it?
To do some EC exp in wearables.

#### What makes it special?
Coin-size and multifunctional.
